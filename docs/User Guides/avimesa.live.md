## Getting Started

This will guide you through adding two sensors and sending simulated data with Device Simulator and viewing them on the chart

**1.** Go to Devices and click on the Device ID with which you want to send data from

**2.** Click on **+** to add a sensor on top right of sensors info. Sensors must be added here otherwise messages sent from a device won't be received properly.

<strong>Next Steps</strong>
</h5>

Before you use real sensors, make sure you delete the simulated ones you created before to prep for real data. First select a sensor, then delete it.

You are now ready to try sending some real data!
